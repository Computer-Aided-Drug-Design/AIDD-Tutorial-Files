# Contributing
Your contributions are welcome! If you adapt a model for materials science or chemistry to work with LitMatter, 
we're happy to add it to the repo to increase visibility and usability for your model. If you use LitMatter for scaling experiments, let us know
(by opening a PR or issue) and we'll add links to your paper, code, data, etc.

## Guidelines
- Open a pull request that adds your classes and a notebook showing the basic training procedure and any other functionality you'd like to highlight.
- In the PR description, give a summary of what your model does and why it might be interesting to investigate the scaling behavior.
- If there's a model you'd like to see added to LitMatter, but you don't feel comfortable adding it yourself, open an Issue to see if someone else would like to contribute.
